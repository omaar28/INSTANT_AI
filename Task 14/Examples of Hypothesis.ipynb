    "<strong>Hypothesis: </strong> Educated guess based on existing knowledge and observation. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses are usually written as ***if/then*** statements that relate a phenomenon to its potential cause.\n",

    "### Types of hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1) Simple hypothesis\n",

    "   2) Complex hypothesis\n",
    "   \n",
    "   3) Null hypothesis\n",

    "   6) Statistical hypothesis\n",
    "   \n",
    "   7) Empirical hypothesis\n",
    "   \n",
    "### All hypotheses mention at least two variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1) Independent variable: The independent variable is the aspect of the situation that changes (for the above example, whether an employee uses their own water bottle).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   2) Dependent variable: The dependent variable is the predicted outcome that results from the independent variable (in this case, how often employees visit the office water cooler).\n",
    "   \n",
    "### How to write a hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1) Make an observation: Notice a recurring phenomenon or event.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   2) Ask a question: Ask yourself why this event might be happening.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   3) Answer the question with a prediction: Offer a possible solution to your original question.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   4) Do some research: Research whether your prediction has already been proven or disproven.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   5) Formulate a hypothesis: Form your prediction into a hypothesis that relates your observation with a potential explanation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Hypothesis examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "      1) Simple hypothesis: \n",
    "   \n",
    "***Employees who bring their own lunch spend less money throughout the day.***\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple hypothesis addresses the relationship between two variables. In this case, the independent variable is whether an employee brings their own lunch, and the dependent variable is how much money they spend throughout the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple hypothesis does not include other variables, such as whether these employees spend money on their commute to work, but additional variables can be considered during the research step to refine a simple hypothesis and make it as specific as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "      2) Complex hypothesis:\n",
    "   \n",
    "***If I give my employees a holiday bonus and paid time off, then they will work harder during the year and increase their morale.***\n",
    "\n",
    "A complex hypothesis examines the relationship between more than two variables. Here, there are two independent variables: giving a holiday bonus and giving paid time off.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also two dependent variables: how hard the employees work and an increase in office morale. A complex hypothesis is most useful in situations that consider a number of factors that have the potential to affect each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "      3) Null hypothesis:\n",
    "   \n",
    "***The number of working hours in a day does not affect employee morale.***\n",
    "\n",
    "A null hypothesis predicts no relationship between an independent and dependent variable and might be created once an original hypothesis between those variables has been disproven. Writing null hypotheses is a great way to consider all possible outcomes of an experiment based on the prediction the original hypothesis made.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "      4) Alternative hypothesis:\n",
    "   \n",
    "***Employees will be more productive if they are given one break every two hours, as opposed to one break every four hours.***\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative hypothesis is created to disprove a null hypothesis after the original hypothesis has already been found to be incorrect. In this example, the original hypothesis might have been \"If an employee is given one break every four hours, they will be more productive,\" and the null hypothesis might have been \"The number of breaks does not have an effect on employee productivity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "      5) Logical hypothesis:\n",
    "   \n",
    "***If an employee is late to work, then traffic must be heavy.***\n",
    "\n",
    "A logical hypothesis is not based on evidence or proven fact but comes from reaching a logical conclusion from observation. There might be other explanations for why an employee would be late to work, and it is not clear whether the employee drove to work or if they took a route with heavy traffic. However, a logical hypothesis can be effective when trying to reach a conclusion and adapt to a problem quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "      6) Statistical hypothesis:\n",
    "   \n",
    "***70% of employees in the office prefer to use a Mac over a PC.***\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistical hypothesis considers a measurable data prediction derived from a set of variables. In this case, the hypothesis makes a prediction about 70% of the employees in an office, though testing might discover that 100% prefer a Mac or that 80% prefer a PC. Writing the initial hypothesis to consider a certain portion of the bigger population provides room for revision and further experimentation based on testing results.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "      7) Empirical hypothesis:\n",
    "   \n",
    "***Employees will complete their work faster if the temperature in an office is 70 degrees.***\n",
    "\n",
    "An empirical hypothesis is based on experiments or observations and lends itself to be proven and supported or to be disproven to form an alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this example, the opportunity for proving the hypothesis could come from changing the temperature of the office after evaluating how quickly employees complete their work when the office is below 70 degrees. An alternative hypothesis for this example could read: \"Employees complete their work faster if the temperature in an office is 68 degrees.\""
